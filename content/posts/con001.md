Continuum damage mechanics was applied to a 3D printed curvilinear carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (c-CFRTP) to predict mechanical response due to loading. The material model was developed by means of finite element analysis, in which user-defined material subroutine was implemented. Elasto-plastic behavior of the 3D printed c-CFRTP including damage initiation and propagation was identified by a monotonic and cyclic tensile tests of the three specimens, i.e. [(+-45]2]S, [(0/90)2]S and [(+-67.5)2]S specimens. Then, the 3D printed curvilinear c-CFRTP was tested in monotonic tensile loading. Non-linear mechanical behavior of the 3D printed curvilinear c-CFRTP due to plasticity and damage initiation and propagation due to tensile loading was well predicted by the numerical simulation.
