A 3D printed fiber-reinforced polymer with high specific stiffness was proposed with the topology and material orientation optimization method. First, the relation between material fraction and effective stiffness was investigated using the numerical material test. Second, anisotropic topology optimization based on effective stiffness obtained by the numerical material test result was performed to maximize the specific stiffness. Third, based on the periodic pattern formation system, the 3D print path generation method realized the continuous 3D print path based on the optimization results. Finally, the material test was performed to validate the high specific stiffness of the proposed structure. The proposed approach brought the full potential of 3D-printed fiber-reinforced polymer, minimizing the structural weight.
