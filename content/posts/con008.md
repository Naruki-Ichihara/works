Perforated plates were 3D printed by carbon fiber reinforced plastic using several print path strategies to study the effect of print paths on the bearing strength in pin-loading. Angle, quasi-isotropic, and concentric print paths showed different bearing strengths. The concentric print path showed higher bearing strength causing material failure at the side of the hole. In contrast, angle and quasi-isotropic print paths showed lower strength, which failed by the separation between print paths and delamination between layers. To improve the strength, the external shape of the plate was changed from a rectangle to a round, which further improved the bearing strength by smoothing the concentric print path for loading direction. It was shown that the design of the print path combined with external shape was important to enhance the mechanical properties of a 3D-printed composite structure.
