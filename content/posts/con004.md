The curvilinear print path generation technique for 3D printing manufacturing of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites was provided. The anisotropic Local-Excitation Global-Inhibition model, which is known as a core logic for pattern formation of biological systems, was applied to generate the optimized 3D print path. An implant stem-like structural part was printed based on the technique. The mechanical testing of the 3D printed structure showed improved stiffness.
