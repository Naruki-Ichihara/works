This paper proposed 3D printing of orthotropic material, carbon fiber-reinforcedpolymers, based on the optimized material orientation and distribution. First, the cross-plyorthotropic material orientation and distribution were optimized using the gradient-basedanisotropic topology optimization method to maximize the structural stiffness. Then, thecontinuous 3D print path was generated from the optimized material orientation and distributionusing the biological pattern-forming system. Finally, the optimized structure was 3D printedbased on the 3D print path by means of the fused filament fabrication. The proposed structurebrought the full potential of orthotropic materials minimizing the structural weight.
