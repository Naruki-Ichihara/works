> I received the *Top award-winning PhD category technical paper of the 2021 SAMPE Japan Symposium at the 2022 SAMPE University Research Symposium* from SAMPE Japan in 2021 and was invited to this conference.

The curvilinear print path generation method for 3D printing of a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) was proposed. The fiber orientation vector field that maximizes the structural stiffness was calculated. Then, the spatiotemporal partial differential growth equations, which have a spatially periodic convergence pattern, were used to generate continuous curves based on the optimized fiber orientation vector field. Finally, the continuous curves were converted to the tool path by image processing. As an example, the CFRTP coupon specimen was 3D prinited based on the optimized curvilinear print path, and mechanical testing was performed to validate the proposed method.
