      <description>The elastic, plastic, and in-plane damage evolutions of a carbon-fiber-reinforced epoxy composite fabricated via filament winding were studied based on continuum damage mechanics. The specific voids and resin-rich region distributions depended on the material and manufacturing conditions. The damage evolutions were expressed by a unified curve, indicating that the continuum damage mechanics approach gave a robust prediction of the damage evolution, although the critical damage at the ultimate failure depended on the material and manufacturing conditions.</description>
