Fibers are oriented along to a principal loading direction to bring out the material\u0026rsquo;s mechanical performance. Conventional human-made fiber-reinforced composites have some design limitations; for example, the fibers only can be controlled at each layer. Recently, several researchers developed the 3D-printing technique for fabricating fiber-reinforced composites. 3D printed composites allow us to achieve further material tailoring. However, the design procedure for curvilinear composites to yield superior performance like natural composites presents some challenges.\nThe complex pattern formulation mechanisms in nature are almost based on \u0026ldquo;Local-activation and Global-inhibition (LAGI) logic.\u0026rdquo; This work proposed a 3D print path generation method based on LAGI logic. The optimized material orientation distribution is working as a morphogen that controls the local orientation of the pattern. Therefore, the global pattern represents the infill structure of 3D-printed composites. Then, the pattern compiles to the G-code for 3D printing by using the imaging process.\nPlease request a whole paper on the research gate if you need a copy of this article.\nNot available.\n","permalink":"https://naruki-ichihara.com/posts/icacc2021/","summary":"Curvilinear natural fiber-reinforced composites are everywhere in organisms.
