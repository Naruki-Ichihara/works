      <description>The 3D printing of continuous carbon fiber–reinforced thermoplastics (c-CFRTP) results in fiber waviness and voids that limit mechanical performance. The effects of tensioning and compaction forces during 3D printing were experimentally studied to suppress fiber waviness. A tensioning force was generated along the filament to straighten the fibers by asynchronously controlling the filament feeding and print speeds. A compaction force was applied through the nozzle tip by setting the layer height to reduce the voids.</description>

      <description>The elastic, plastic, and in-plane damage evolutions of a carbon-fiber-reinforced epoxy composite fabricated via filament winding were studied based on continuum damage mechanics. The specific voids and resin-rich region distributions depended on the material and manufacturing conditions. The damage evolutions were expressed by a unified curve, indicating that the continuum damage mechanics approach gave a robust prediction of the damage evolution, although the critical damage at the ultimate failure depended on the material and manufacturing conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of a Perimeter on the Post-failure Behavior of Fiber-reinforced Polymer Composite Lattices</title>

      <description>The post-failure behavior of a fiber-reinforced polymer composite lattice was experimentally studied using a beam structure. Anisotropic topology optimization was conducted to maximize the structural stiffness and partial latticing to improve toughness. Subsequently, an infill structure was generated from the optimized results using a phase field approach. The perimeter of the two-dimensional beam structure was generated from a binary solution of the optimized results. Optimized composite lattice structures were obtained using three-dimensional printing.</description>

      <description>The toughness of structures is essential to prevent catastrophic failure. This study introduced a design framework to improve the toughness of 3D-printed carbon fiber-reinforced composite structures by local latticing utilizing the intermediate material fraction obtained in the topology optimization. The framework was based on anisotropic topology optimization considering material fraction and material orientation. The optimized results were de-homogenized by the phase field-based technique to determine the 3D printing path. Experimental validations were carried out on a three-point bending beam problem.</description>

      <description>Perforated plates were 3D printed by carbon fiber reinforced plastic using several print path strategies to study the effect of print paths on the bearing strength in pin-loading. Angle, quasi-isotropic, and concentric print paths showed different bearing strengths. The concentric print path showed higher bearing strength causing material failure at the side of the hole. In contrast, angle and quasi-isotropic print paths showed lower strength, which failed by the separation between print paths and delamination between layers.</description>

      <description>A 3D printed fiber-reinforced polymer with high specific stiffness was proposed with the topology and material orientation optimization method. First, the relation between material fraction and effective stiffness was investigated using the numerical material test. Second, anisotropic topology optimization based on effective stiffness obtained by the numerical material test result was performed to maximize the specific stiffness. Third, based on the periodic pattern formation system, the 3D print path generation method realized the continuous 3D print path based on the optimization results.</description>

      <description>I received the Top award-winning PhD category technical paper of the 2021 SAMPE Japan Symposium at the 2022 SAMPE University Research Symposium from SAMPE Japan in 2021 and was invited to this conference.
The curvilinear print path generation method for 3D printing of a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) was proposed. The fiber orientation vector field that maximizes the structural stiffness was calculated. Then, the spatiotemporal partial differential growth equations, which have a spatially periodic convergence pattern, were used to generate continuous curves based on the optimized fiber orientation vector field.</description>

      <title>Fail-safe metamaterials with 3D printed fiber reinforced polymers</title>

      <description>Fail-safe is a design philosophy that ensures the structure&amp;rsquo;s safety under unexpected loading. Fail-safe structures often consist of many struts or parts because these structures prevent catastrophic failure with their structural redundancy. However, the fail-safe structures suffer the increasing number of components and enlarged structure size. Therefore, the knowledge to design mechanical structures that enclose a small number of components and are fail-safe stays challenging.
Recent advanced additive manufacturing technologies provide complex and delicate structures that blur the boundary between &amp;ldquo;structure&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;material.</description>

      <description>This paper proposed 3D printing of orthotropic material, carbon fiber-reinforcedpolymers, based on the optimized material orientation and distribution. First, the cross-plyorthotropic material orientation and distribution were optimized using the gradient-basedanisotropic topology optimization method to maximize the structural stiffness. Then, thecontinuous 3D print path was generated from the optimized material orientation and distributionusing the biological pattern-forming system. Finally, the optimized structure was 3D printedbased on the 3D print path by means of the fused filament fabrication.</description>

      <description>Curvilinear natural fiber-reinforced composites are everywhere in organisms. Fibers are oriented along to a principal loading direction to bring out the material&amp;rsquo;s mechanical performance. Conventional human-made fiber-reinforced composites have some design limitations; for example, the fibers only can be controlled at each layer. Recently, several researchers developed the 3D-printing technique for fabricating fiber-reinforced composites. 3D printed composites allow us to achieve further material tailoring. However, the design procedure for curvilinear composites to yield superior performance like natural composites presents some challenges.</description>

      <description>A framework to produce an optimized infill structure for 3D-printed curvilinear fiber-reinforced polymer composites is proposed. The material orientation was optimized first to maximize the physical properties. Then, the phase field of the stripe pattern was developed based on the optimized material orientation vector field using the local activation and long-range inhibition system for the formation of biological patterns. Finally, the phase field was converted into a 3D print path. The proposed approach was validated both numerically and experimentally.</description>

      <description>The curvilinear print path generation technique for 3D printing manufacturing of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites was provided. The anisotropic Local-Excitation Global-Inhibition model, which is known as a core logic for pattern formation of biological systems, was applied to generate the optimized 3D print path. An implant stem-like structural part was printed based on the technique. The mechanical testing of the 3D printed structure showed improved stiffness.

      <description>Continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based on finite element analysis was performed to predict the mechanical behavior of a 3D-printed curvilinear continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (c-CFRTP). Elastoplastic properties of the 3D-printed c-CFRTP including damage initiation, evolution, and propagation were identified using monotonic and cyclic tensile tests for three specimens, i.e. [(±45)2]S, [(0/90)2]S, and [(±67.5)2]S. Then, S-shaped curvilinear c-CFRTP was 3D-printed and tested in monotonic tensile loading. The non-linear mechanical behavior of an S-shaped curvilinear c-CFRTP due to tensile loading was well predicted by means of finite element analysis using the constructed CDM-based material model.</description>

      <description>Continuum damage mechanics was applied to a 3D printed curvilinear carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (c-CFRTP) to predict mechanical response due to loading. The material model was developed by means of finite element analysis, in which user-defined material subroutine was implemented. Elasto-plastic behavior of the 3D printed c-CFRTP including damage initiation and propagation was identified by a monotonic and cyclic tensile tests of the three specimens, i.e. [(+-45]2]S, [(0/90)2]S and [(+-67.5)2]S specimens.</description>
