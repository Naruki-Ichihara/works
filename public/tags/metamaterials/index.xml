      <description>Fail-safe is a design philosophy that ensures the structure&amp;rsquo;s safety under unexpected loading. Fail-safe structures often consist of many struts or parts because these structures prevent catastrophic failure with their structural redundancy. However, the fail-safe structures suffer the increasing number of components and enlarged structure size. Therefore, the knowledge to design mechanical structures that enclose a small number of components and are fail-safe stays challenging.
Recent advanced additive manufacturing technologies provide complex and delicate structures that blur the boundary between &amp;ldquo;structure&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;material.</description>
